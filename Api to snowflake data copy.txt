Extract data from REST API
Load the data into a file
Copy the file to an S3 bucket
Load the data from S3 to Snowflake

Step 1: Extract Data from REST API
First, let's use the requests library to fetch data from a REST API.

Python
import requests
import json

# Replace with your API endpoint
api_url = 'https://api.example.com/data'
response = requests.get(api_url)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
else:
    raise Exception(f"API request failed with status code {response.status_code}")

# Save data to a file
with open('data.json', 'w') as file:
    json.dump(data, file)


Step 2: Copy the File to an S3 Bucket
We'll use the boto3 library to upload the JSON file to an S3 bucket.

Python
import boto3

# Replace with your AWS credentials and bucket details
s3_client = boto3.client('s3', 
                         aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
                         aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY')

bucket_name = 'your-bucket-name'
file_name = 'data.json'
s3_key = 'path/to/upload/data.json'

s3_client.upload_file(file_name, bucket_name, s3_key)

Step 3: Load the Data from S3 to Snowflake
We'll use the snowflake-connector-python library to connect to Snowflake and load the data from the S3 bucket.

Python
import snowflake.connector

# Replace with your Snowflake credentials and details
conn = snowflake.connector.connect(
    user='YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_USER',
    password='YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD',
    account='YOUR_SNOWFLAKE_ACCOUNT'
)

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Replace with your Snowflake stage and table details
s3_stage = '@your_s3_stage'
snowflake_table = 'your_table_name'

# Copy data from S3 to Snowflake
cur.execute(f"""
    COPY INTO {snowflake_table}
    FROM {s3_stage}/path/to/upload/data.json
    FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'JSON')
""")

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()

Summary
Extract data from the REST API: We fetched data from a REST API and saved it to a file.
Copy the file to an S3 bucket: We uploaded the file to an S3 bucket using boto3.
Load the data from S3 to Snowflake: We loaded the data from the S3 bucket to a Snowflake table using snowflake-connector-python.
Make sure to replace placeholders with your actual API endpoint, AWS credentials, S3 bucket details, and Snowflake credentials.
